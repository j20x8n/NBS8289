NBS8289 - Research Methods
End-of-module summative assessment
In your end-of-module summative assessment, you should address the following   brief:
With reference to academic literature, discuss the issues   to   be   considered   when analysing research data.
[The assessment brief is asking you to write about the things that   a   researcher   should take into account when   analysing research data:   what   should   a   researcher   think about when planning their data analysis and/or when analysing their   data?].
In your response, you   must draw on and   cite   at   least four   methodological journal   articles and two empirical journal articles on a topic relevant for your   programme of study.
In completing your Assessment,   you must engage with recent   research   - that   is:
                  methodological articles that have been   published   in the   past   10 years
                  empirical articles that have a publication   date   in   the   last   7   years
Methodological journal articles
                  The   Module’s   Reading   List includes more than 50   methodological journal
articles – you can choose relevant articles from this   list to develop your   essay.
                  If you wish to source your own methodological articles, that meet the   essential   requirements of the brief, then see the   Module's Reading   list,   'Journals   -
Methodology and Methods' section for journal titles.
                  You must choose a methodological article that   considers   a   qualitative   method   of data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis) or a quantitative   method   of data analysis (e.g. regression analysis).   Do not   draw on   an   article   that   uses   mixed   data   (both   qualitative   and   quantitative).
                  For advice on sourcing articles via the Library website,   the   Library   have   produced this blog -> ‘Finding empirical and methodological   articles’
Empirical journal articles
   
                  The   Module’s   Reading   List includes more than 50 empirical journal articles –   you can choose relevant articles from this   list to develop   your   essay.
                  If you wish to source your own empirical articles, that meet the essential
requirements of the brief, then you can search within a range   of   journal   titles
including The   International   Journal   of   Human   Resource   Management;   Journal
ofInternational   Business   Studies;   Work,   Employment   and   Society; Organization   Studies; Journal of International Management; Employee   Relations   and Human    Resource   Management   Journal. For more journal titles that relate to your programme of study see the 'Module   Handbook'.
                  You must choose a methodological article that   considers   a   qualitative   method   of data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis) or a quantitative   method   of data analysis (e.g. regression analysis).   Do not   draw on   an   article   that   uses   mixed   data   (both   qualitative   and   quantitative).
                  For advice on sourcing articles via the Library website,   the   Library   have   produced this blog -> ‘Finding empirical and methodological   articles’
Approaching the Assessment:You choose the method of data analysis that will form. the   basis of your essay,   but   you might choose to write about the data analysis   method that   most   interests you   (this could be the approach that you are likely   to   use   in your   future   studies).
Whatever method of data analysis you choose to write about in   your   essay;   first,   proactively engage with the module’s ‘data analysis’ materials. Next,   read the   relevant chapter in the   module’s text book to   build your   foundational   knowledge   around data analysis.
Then, search for methodological articles that discuss your chosen approach.   Read the articles to acquire further knowledge of the data analysis approach; for   example, what are its strengths, weaknesses, when is   it   useful, what   are   the   potential   problems etc.   Note: you would not   simply describe the strengths   and   weaknesses   etc. of the approach to data analysis in your essay;   rather, this   broad   knowledge         gives you a foundation to   build on.
Next, search for empirical articles that use your chosen approach to   data   analysis   and consider w代 写NBS8289 - Research MethodsSQL

Read the empirical article/s with   the   aim   of   understanding the research project - its   aims,   processes   and   claims. Then,   you   can   apply and integrate your knowledge from the methodological journal articles with your knowledge of the empirical journal articles to address the Assessment brief.
